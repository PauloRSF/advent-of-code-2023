# Advent of Code 2023

These are my solutions for the [2023 edition of Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023). I'll implement each solution in a different programming language (that i never used, preferrably) following an alphabetic order.

## How to run

### Requirements

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker)
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make)

To run a solution, you need to create a file called `input.txt` in the respective challenge directory and then run `make NUMBER`, where `number` is the two-digit (zero-padded to the left) challenge's day number.

For example, if you want to run the day 3 solution:

```sh
$ touch 03-gear-ratios/input.txt # You'll need to copy your input from the website to this file
$ make 03
```
